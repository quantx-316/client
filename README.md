# client

## CI/CD Deployment

- Netlify 
  - https://quantx-algo.netlify.app/ (quantx taken)
  - NOT guaranteed to be the most up to date (takes too many resources to rebuild every commit)

## SETUP 

yarn start
  Starts the development server.
  - Set up server / db using docker, run client separately!

yarn build
  Bundles the app into static files for production.

yarn test
  Starts the test runner.

yarn eject
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
